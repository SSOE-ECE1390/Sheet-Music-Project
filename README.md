# Sheet-Music-Project
"""
This is a computer vision based project that utilized image processing pipelines and machine learning algorithms to utilize sheet music of variable sizes, quality, and length, and outputs a auditory signal that is the music in the sheet music.

## Team Members:

**Oliver Kettleson-Belinkie**, OWK9@pitt.edu

**Phillip Lavrenyuk**, PJL43@pitt.edu

**Jaiden Steele**, JDH191@pitt.edu

**Bell Hsia**, IBH5@pitt.edu"

## To Do:
1. Source/Locate the sheet music images
2. Think of/research common artifacts/noise found in sheet music images for preprocessing
3. Create a function(s) that perfroms the needed preprocessing (e.g., filtering, enhancements)
4. Research/study ML algorithms that take music notes and turn them into auditory signals (specifically, look into what features they use and the required format of the features) 
5. Find a way and create a function that extracts the features that will be used in the ML algorithm
6. Find the best way to store the output audio signals, and also the best way to convert them into actual sound from computer speakers
7. Integrate the image preprocessing pipeline and the ML algorithm so they work seamlessly
